    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <div class="intro">

      <p>My educational background is a unique mix of philosophy, social science, and computer science that partially reflects my interests. My career began around 2000 and I spent most of it as a journalist. I made the decision to acquire knowledge and delve deeper into computer science and web development during the first wave of COVID-19. I love to develop websites that are easy to navigate, accessible, responsive, fast to load, sustainable and SEO friendly. Designing and writing are also things I enjoy.</p>

      <img src="Screenshot_ADS.png" alt="ADS website screenshot" class="aligned"> 
      <p>The previous static website had a classic WordPress theme and was developed using a page builder. I suggested a total rethink and the incorporation of dynamic elements. I created a website theme using a modern block editor. The performance, accessibility, SEO, and best practices insight of the website on both desktop and mobile devices have become excellent. The CEO, while thanking, said, "Many thanks, Rizwan. I must acknowledge that the ADS website has improved a lot, especially in terms of appearances/aesthetics and ease of use." The web admin can now post events, news, opinions, and videos on the website in a dynamic and easy manner. The block editor allows him/her to make changes to the static parts.</p>

      <b>Siraiki Digital Library</b> | 
      <a href="https://siraiki.com">siraiki.com</a>
      <p>This site was created by me using Divi. In 2024, I redesigned and developed it from scratch using a block theme. While the text on the web is usually from right to left, the website has the ability to render left-to-right text correctly. The project is currently ongoing.</p>

      <b>Lok Sujag</b> | 
      <a href="http://loksujag.com/">loksujag.com</a>
      <p>The previous website of the company had functional and SEO-related problems. I was responsible for coordinating between the company and the software house in order to develop the website once again. My work included technical advisory, quality assurance, SEO, social media marketing, and management. The success of SEO led to the stories on websites appearing on the first or second page of Google search, alongside mainstream media.</p>

    <h3>Typography</h3> 

    <div class="cert">
      <img src="Screenshot_nastaleeq.png" alt="Siraiki Nastaleeq screenshot" class="aligned"> 
      <p>To render Siraiki/Saraiki text correctly, I modified two Persian and an Urdu fonts in Naskh style and created Visakh, Mundhla, and Koonj. (see: seraikifonts.sourceforge.io). In order to add Siraiki alphabets, I upgraded the Nafees Nastaleeq font, a sophisticated nastaliq style font, and created Siraika. FontForge was the tool I used for this purpose.</p>
